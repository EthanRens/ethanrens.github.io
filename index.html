		<p> hi my name is Ethan Rens, I like to watch movies, play games, and hangout with friends. I just recently saw a movie called <i>silent night, deadly night</i> and it was probably one of the worst movies I have ever watched. After the film was over my friends discovered that there were 5 sequals. I am being forced to watch them all. I hate that movie. I have a brother and sister aswell as a cat and a dog. My dog is a chocholate lab and I will post a picture of her!</p>
